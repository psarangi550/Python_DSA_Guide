# <ins>  Time and space complexity Of An 2D Array </ins> #

|  Operation               | Time complexity      | Space complexity |
|--------------------------|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| creating an empty 2D Array  |        O(1)          |  O(1)     |                  
| creating an 2D Array with elements|O(MN)      |   O(MN)    |
|inserting a row/column in an array | O(MN) | O(MN) |
| Traversing a given 2D array | O(MN) | O(1) |
| Accessing a given 2D array Element | O(1)  | O(1) |
| Searching for a given value in 2D array | O(MN) | O(1) |
| deleting an Element from Array | O(MN) | O(MN) |


- while inserting an row/column the time complexity and space complexity for them will be O(MN) because numpy will inserting the element to the `2D Array`  a new array with `updated dimention` will going to be get created anf the `preveious value will be copied wto the new value with new row/column value in here `

- same goes for the `remove` operation as well and time complexity and space complexity for them will be O(MN) because numpy will inserting the element to the `2D Array`  a new array with `updated dimention` will going to be get created anf the `preveious value will be copied wto the new value without  row/column value we deleted `
