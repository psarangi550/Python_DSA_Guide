# <ins> Array in Python </ins> #

- `Array` is not a python `native data type` , we can use the `numpy or array`  module to create `array` datastructure in python 

- for specific `array` data type is `more memory efficient `compare to the `python list` for `spevcific data structure`

- Array store the element in the `contigious block of memory without pointer` which reduces `memory overhed`

- but the `Array` DS can only store a `particular store a particular DataType ` 

- All the `elements` in an array `Are next to each other` , there are no gap beween them, hence they are `contiguous`

- Each element can be found out based on their location 

- An array is a `collection of same type` and we can access the element based on their `index number`

# <ins> Type of Array </ins> #

- There are 2 type of array 

    - one dimentional Array

        - An `One dimentional Array` is  an Array with bunch of values thats been declared with `single index value`

        - here the `index` can be between `0->N` and element can be accessed using `a[i]`

        - `One Dimentional Array` has `one row` but have `multiple columns`

        - the `indexes` inside the one dimentional array is `unique` in nature

        - we can access the element using the `<name of the array>[<index of the Array>]`


    - multi dimentional array 

        - Two Dimentional Array

            - in case of the Two Dimentional Array ` the number of rows` is more than `One`

            - in case of `Two Dimentional Array` we have `multiple columns and multiple rows`

            - here in this case `each row` and `each column` has its own index value which can be from `0-N`

            - `Two Dimentional` Array consist of `multiple one dimentional Array` over here 

            - we can access the element of the two dimentional array we can use the `<array name>[<row index number>][<column index number>]`

            - we alsways need to consider the `row index number first` and then consider the `column index number`

        - Three Dimentional

            - The `Three Dimentional Array` which is similar to the `Two Dimentional Array` but has a `depth value`

            - consider the `Three dimentional Array` multiple `Two Dimentional Array`

            - Best example of the `3 Dimentional Array` is a `cube` having number on them 

            - Each face of the `cube` of number have the `2 dimentional array`

            - in order to access the element of `Three dimentional Array` we need to consider the `first index as the depth`

            - in case fo the three dimentional array we need to consider the 

                - Depth index first

                - row index number

                - column index number 

            - here the `depth index means` from the `edge` what the counted number value is
            




        - Four Dimentional
        - N Dimentional
