# <ins> Big-O Notation </ins> #

- Big-O notation is the `language` or `metrics` to define the `performances` of `Algorithm`

- `time complexity` means how to `time` of the `runtime program increases` when the `input of the program increases`

- in `Time complexity` we are not measuring the `time` rather we are measuring the `number of  operation that been performed`

- `space complexity` is the `amount of memory` the code been using 

- when we are pinting the wall with `w` as the weight and `h` as the height  then we can see that the `Big-O-Notation` for the same is of `o(wh)` to paint the whole wall

# <ins> What is Theta Omega and Big-O Notation </ins> #

- these are different `notation` used to define the `runtime` for a programs 

- algorithm can `perform differently` based on `the condition` that been provided into the same 

- we can see the time take by the `code` based  on the `Best/Worst/Average scenarios`

- with the help of the `Big-O` notatyion we can define the `best/worstand average case` of the algorithm

- there are 3 greek words we will see when calculating the `Big-O Notation`

    - omega

    - theta

    - omicron known as (Bog-O)

- when we are iterating over all the `element of an array` in order to fetch the required element that can be `worse` case as it taking more time  which can be represented by `omicron` or `BigO`

- when we are searching for the `first element in the array` then that can be `Best case where we find the element easily` which can be represented by `omega`

- when we fetch the middle element then we can see that those will be taking the `average best case` which can be represented by `theta`

- hence the `omicron or Big-O` always consider the `worst case scenario`

- BigO :- it is the complexity that is going to be less than or equal to the worst case

- Big-Omega :- it is the complexity to measure the `at least or more than the best case scenario`

- Big-Theta :- it is going to represent the `time bound` between the `best` or `worse` case scenarios
