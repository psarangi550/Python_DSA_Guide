# <ins> What is DataStructure and Why we need it </ins> #

- Datastructure is `different way of storing Data Into the computers` that can  used efficiently 

- the performance and eefficiency of the software , How the data is `stored and organised` during the program execution 

# <ins> What is An Algorithm and Why we need it </ins> #

- `Algorithm` is nothing but `instruction to perform a Task`

- After the `data structure` structure the data in more efficient way then we can `perform set of instruction to perform task which known as the Algorithm`

- The task we perform `Day to Day` we also perform `day to day task to perform some Task`

- `Graph` Algorithm is used for fetching the shortest path which being used by `google maps`

- `audio and video compression algorithm` used by the facebook to trasmit the `data`

- `optimisation and scheduling algoritm` to use the `solar pannel on the international space station`

we need to use the below feature to find the new algorithm

    - correctness

    - effectiveness

# <ins> Type of DataStructure <ins> #

- in python the `DataStructure` can be divided into `primitive and non-primitive sections`

    - `primitive` datastructure `can't be devided` further more into `smaller data type`

    - but the `non-primitive` data structure can be devided into more simpler `smaller data types`

    - `primitive` DS are have a fixed size and usually `fixed` in size and `non-primitive` can `grow or shrink` dynamically

    - `non primitive` DataStructure can consist of `multiple primitive Data Structure`

    - `non primitive ` DS used for complex operation such as  `data manipulation , searching and sorting `

    - `primitive` data structure presented in memory as a `simple value` , but non primitive `Data Structure` are represented in memoryu as `pointer` to the `other location on the memory`

    - `non primitive` DS be devided into 2 more types and those are of 

        - linear non primitive DS

            - `linear non primitive DS` where the element are placed in sequencial order where each element linked to the adjacent element

            - here the `order` in which `item` are placed are important

            - type of `linear Non primitive DS`

                - List

                - Array

                - Tuple

                - Linked List

                - Stack

                - Queue 

        - Non Linear non Primitive DS

            - ` Non linear non primitive DS` are the elements which is `not placed sequencially`
            
            -  this DS hierachical `relationship between the data elements ` 

            - here one element can linked to another element in ome more multiple ways

                - Set

                - Dictionary

                - Tree

                - Graph

        - we can also fetch the `above DS into` 2 different typpes

            - Builtin DS

                - from the Linear `Non Primitive DS` one there are 2 `Builtin DS` which comes along with python 

                    - List

                    - Tuple

                 from the `non lineear DS` there are also 2 different `Builtin DS` and those are of

                    - Set

                    - Dictionary

            - User Defined DS 

                - for the rest we can use the external library or we can built it using the `Builtin DS`


# <ins> Type of Algorithm in Python <ins> #


    -  some of the common algorithm in python are of 

        - sorting Algorithm

            - storing the data in sequenchial order

        - searching Algorithm

            -  to find a specific value in the data set

        - Graph Algorithm

            - To work with the Data which can be represented in the graph 

        - Dynamic Programming Algoritm

            - To Solve the problem by breaking the problem down to multiple  sub problems 

            - examples are of 

                - knapshack problem

        - Devide and Conqure Algorithm

            - To Solve the problem by breaking the problem down to multiple  sub problems  and solve each problem independently and then combining the result 

            - Merge sort 

            - Quick Sort

        - Recursive Algorithm

            - To Solve the problem by breaking the problem down to multiple  sub problems  where sub problem are similar in nature
