# <ins> common Runtime Complexity for Algorithm </ins> #

- O(1) :- constant :- A Simple Add Number function 

    - for every given input the `the execution will not change` it will remain be the same 

    - where the number of operation will remain be the `1`

    - when are picking a card at random then we can see that the complexity will be `O(1)` as we are performing one operation but not perforimg more than that 

    - when we are plotting this on the `graph` having tthe `number of operation` as the `y-axis` and the `elements input` on the `x-axis` then the graph comes as `flat constant` near the x-axis

    - this  also be consideered as the `1 time /constant time complexity` which is the `best` efficient code


- O(N) :- Linear :- loop through the number 1 to n

    - here the `number of operation` `increases` when the number of `input data increases`

    - best practise to run the code below the `O(N) complexity` which is not always possible

    - `linear` or `O(N)` will going to be get performed when the `number of operation performed` for `input number that we have provided`

    - when we are printing `each number till the input number` using the `for-loop` as we are performing the `print` operation multiple times base on the `input number` provide then the complexity becomes the `O(N)`

    - when based on the `input number` of the `number of operation` increasing then that considered as the `linear or BigO(N)` complexity

    - when we pass the number `n` then the `number of operation` going to be performed `n times`

    - when are picking a specific card then we have to go through all the cards to reach to the specific cards then that becoames linear or `BigO(N)` complexity which is dependent on the `deck of card is `
    
    -  when we are plotting this on the `graph` having tthe `number of operation` as the `y-axis` and the `elements input` on the `x-axis` then the graph comes as `directly propotional` near the x-axis and y-axis 

    - here `linear progress` happens when the `number of operation increases based on the input tht we have provided`

    

- O(logn) :- Logarithmic :- when we are finding the element from the sorted Array 

- O(N^2) :- Quadratic :-For a Nested Loops

- O(2^n) :- Double recurssion in fibonacci series
