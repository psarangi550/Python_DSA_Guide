# <ins> Python List In details </ins> #

- `list` is a python `built in module` such as `tuple/dictionary/set`

- A `list` is a `data structure` that holds an ordered `collection` of item , `sequence of item` can be stored to the list

- here the `ordered` means the `way` we have `declared element in the List` it will stay as it is `element will not change in this case`

- `list` can be considered `shopping list` where each `item instead of mentioning on the new line we are mentioning the same separated by comma`

- the `list of item` tht we want to `store` should be `saved by the square bracket` as `[item1,item2,item3,...]`

- thr `elements or item` in the `list` should not have to `same type` unlike `in case of an array`

- we can create a `list` inside another `list` which is known as the `Nested List` in this case , where the `nested list` also considered as the `single element in the list`
