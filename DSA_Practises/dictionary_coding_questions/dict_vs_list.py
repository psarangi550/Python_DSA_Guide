# dict vs List 

# What is the difference between the List and dict 

# List

    # in case of the List elements inside it is ordered hence List is Ordered in nature
    #  here the element are stored in the memory  as the order we are providing into the List
    # here in case of the List element can be accessed using the indexes 
    # this is a collection of element in here 
    # prefered when we have the ordered Data 
    # List allow duplicated elements 
    

# Dict

    # we can access the values based on the keys which is efficient if we know key
    # it is a collection of key-value pair
    # prefered when we have thwe unique key and values
    # No duplicated elements as the keys can't be duplicated but the values can be
